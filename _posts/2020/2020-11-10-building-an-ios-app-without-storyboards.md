Written with Xcode 12.1 targeting iOS 14.1.

## Why should I?
Interface Builder is great whilst you‚Äôre learning on your own, but as your app and team grows, you‚Äôre likely to have regular fights with merge conflicts because of storyboards. They just don‚Äôt play well with version control.

## Okay, I'm sold. How do I do this?
Glad you asked.

1. Start a new project (single view template is great). Once it‚Äôs ready, delete Main.storyboard from the Project navigator (Right-click -> Delete -> üëãüèº
2. Next, click on your project‚Äôs Info.plist file and delete the two highlighted keys:

![Xcode build settings](/assets/images/xcode-build-settings.png)

3. Now head on over to SceneDelegate.swift and make it like so:

```swift
import UIKit

final class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

        // this is a great place to build and inject any dependencies into your root view controller
        let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: ViewController()) // a
        let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene) // b
        self.window = window // c
        window.rootViewController = navigationController // d
        window.makeKeyAndVisible() // e
    }
}
```

a. Firstly, we build a new navigation controller to house our root view controller, which in this case is the standard one that Apple‚Äôs template gave us.

b. Then we build a new window using the scene object.

c. Then we set the app‚Äôs window to our newly-built one.

d. Then we assign the previously-built navigation controller as window‚Äôs root view controller.

e. Finally, we position the window on top of all others.

6. And then in ViewController.swift, like so:

```swift
import UIKit

final class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        title = "No Boards"

        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground // 1
    }
}
```

Now, you‚Äôll be in exactly the same place before we started, but without a pesky storyboard to get in the way, and the ability to take better advantage of dependency injection. Nice üôåüèº

You may have noticed that my code snippets above are very lean. That‚Äôs how I code, as least clutter as possible. The first thing I do when I start a new projects is all of the above, as well as gutting Apple‚Äôs boilerplate & comments. Less is more, to me ü§òüèº
