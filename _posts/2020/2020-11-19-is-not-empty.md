title: IsNotEmpty - A Simple Extension to Improve Readability when Checking the Count of Collections in Swift
tags: extensions, collections

Long title, I know.
I don‚Äôt know about you, but my mind always jolts a little when I read something like below (line 9):

```swift
let bands = [
    "Megadeth",
    "Metallica",
    "Anthrax",
    "Slayer"
]

// if the bands array is not empty
if !bands.isEmpty {
    // do some stuff here
}
```

Okay, this is a small example, but it does illustrate the point: who speaks or writes like that! ‚Äúif not bands is empty‚Ä¶‚Äù
For readability, I just had a brainstorm: extend the Collection protocol to provide something more readable:

```swift
extension Collection {
    var isNotEmpty: Bool {
        return !self.isEmpty
    }
}

let bands = [
    "Megadeth",
    "Metallica",
    "Anthrax",
    "Slayer"
]

// if the bands array is not empty
if bands.isNotEmpty {
    // do stuff here
}
```

Notice that it reads way more like English now: ‚Äúif bands is not empty‚Ä¶‚Äù
The ugliness with the *notting* is done once, hidden away in the extension on line 3, leaving your code that uses it, tr√®s readable.
And because it is declared as an extension to `Collection`, you get this simple tweak for `Array`, `Set` and `Dictionary` at the same time. Noice!
